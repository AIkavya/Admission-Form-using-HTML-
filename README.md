Hi, my name is Kavya. This is a responsive webpage I created for a university admission form to practice and showcase my front-end development skills.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the page.
* **CSS3:** For all styling and layout. The responsive design for different screen sizes was implemented with the assistance of AI tools.
